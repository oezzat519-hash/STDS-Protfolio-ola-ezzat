# STDS Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio

This repository presents a curated portfolio of hands-on tasks and a final project completed as part of the **STDS Data Science Program**.  
The work focuses on applying **data science and analytics thinking** to real-world problems, with emphasis on data quality, pipeline design, and analytical decision-making.

---

## Overview

The objective of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Work with real-world, imperfect datasets
- Design logical and scalable data workflows
- Apply data science principles beyond model building
- Communicate technical solutions in a structured and professional manner

The repository includes both **individual hands-on tasks** and a comprehensive **end-to-end final project**.

## Technical Scope & Tools

- **Excel** – Data preparation, cleaning, and exploratory analysis  
- **SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)** – Data querying, validation, and transformation  
- **Power BI** – Analytical dashboards and reporting  
- **Tableau** – Data visualization and storytelling  
- **ETL & Data Pipeline Design** – Conceptual, serverless, event-driven architectures

## Final Project: GreenStream Energy

### Project Description
The final project focuses on designing a **conceptual serverless ETL pipeline** for a smart energy provider collecting electricity consumption data from 50,000 households.

The solution transforms raw smart-meter data into clean, structured, and analytics-ready datasets while addressing real-world data quality challenges.

### Key Design Focus
- Event-driven ETL architecture
- Clear separation of data layers (raw, processed, analytics)
- Data cleaning, validation, and standardization
- Faulty smart-meter detection logic
- Analytics-optimized storage for long-term analysis

### Business Value
- Enables accurate peak consumption analysis
- Improves data reliability and trust
- Prepares high-quality datasets for forecasting and machine learning use cases

## Key Competencies Demonstrated

- Data Quality & Validation  
- ETL Architecture Design  
- Analytical Problem Solving  
- System-Level Thinking  
- Professional Technical Documentation

## Notes

This repository is intended as a **portfolio showcase** rather than a production implementation.  
The emphasis is placed on **design reasoning, data logic, and analytical thinking**, not cloud-specific configurations or tools.
